# container-orchestrator

Self-hosted Kubernetes platform for running containerized GitHub apps on a Mac
Mini, with automatic image-driven deployments from GHCR.

## Goals

- One Mac Mini today; cluster grows by adding more Mac Minis later, without
  rebuilding anything.
- Apps live in their own GitHub repos. CI builds an image, pushes it to GHCR,
  and the cluster picks it up on its next poll — no manual `kubectl apply`.
- Stateful apps survive rolling updates (PVCs).
- LAN-only today; opening to the public is a config flip later (cert-manager
  is pre-installed but dormant).

## Cluster backends

Two backends are supported via the same set of manifests, charts, and scripts.
Switching is a `kubectl config use-context` away.

| Backend | Status | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Docker Desktop K8s** | active | Single Mac Mini, simplest setup |
| **k3s in Lima** | scaffolded, dormant | Once you add a second Mac Mini |

The platform components (ingress-nginx, cert-manager, Keel) and all app
manifests are deliberately distro-agnostic — PVCs use the cluster's default
StorageClass, ingress is a controller we install ourselves, no LoadBalancer
services. See [`platform/k3s/MIGRATION.md`](platform/k3s/MIGRATION.md) for the
switch-over procedure.

## Quick start

```sh
make bootstrap     # one-time: install platform components on the active context
make deploy        # apply every app under apps/
make status        # show cluster + apps + ingress URLs
```

## Repo layout

```
platform/
  bootstrap.sh             entry point — detects context, installs components
  docker-desktop/          notes for enabling DD's built-in K8s
  k3s/                     Lima VM configs + migration doc (dormant today)
  components/              cluster add-ons applied by bootstrap.sh
charts/app/                generic reusable Helm chart for an "app"
apps/<name>/values.yaml    per-app config consumed by charts/app
ci/templates/              drop-in GitHub Actions workflow for app repos
scripts/                   deploy / status / switch-cluster
```

## Auto-deploy flow

1. Push to `main` in an app repo → GitHub Actions runs tests, builds a
   `linux/arm64` image, pushes to `ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>[/<service>]:main` and
   `:sha-<short>`.
2. [Keel](https://keel.sh) polls GHCR every 5 minutes. When `:main`'s digest
   changes, Keel triggers a rolling update of the matching Deployment.
3. Stateful pods retain their PVCs across the rollout.

When you go public, the polling can be replaced by a webhook from Actions for
near-instant deploys.
